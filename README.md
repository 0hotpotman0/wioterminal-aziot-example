[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kartben/wioterminal-azureiothub-sample.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kartben/wioterminal-azureiothub-sample)

This sample application shows you how to connect your [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html) from Seeed Studio to Azure IoT Hub. 

It is built on top of the recently unveiled [Azure SDK for Embedded C](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c), a small footprint, easy-to-port library for communicating with Azure services.

As [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) [supports](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/boards/atmelsam/seeed_wio_terminal.html) the Wio Terminal, the sample comes in the form a PlatformIO project. This means that you don't have to worry about installing the [multiple Arduino libraries](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Network-Overview/) the Wio Terminal requires for Wi-Fi & TLS, and you don't need to manually install any other third-party library either! All dependencies are automatically fetched from Github by the PlatformIO Library Manager.

## Running the sample

In order to run the sample, update the macro declarations in [``config.h``](include/config.h) with your Wi-Fi SSID and password, as well as IoT Hub credentials (IoT hostname, device ID, and device key).

```cpp
// Wifi
#define IOT_CONFIG_WIFI_SSID            "SSID"
#define IOT_CONFIG_WIFI_PASSWORD        "PWD"

// Azure IoT
#define IOT_CONFIG_IOTHUB_FQDN          "[your Azure IoT host name].azure-devices.net"
#define IOT_CONFIG_DEVICE_ID            "Device ID"
#define IOT_CONFIG_DEVICE_KEY           "Device Key"
```

Use the [PlatformIO IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide) (VS Code extension) or the [PlatformIO command-line interface](https://platformio.org/install/cli) to deploy the application to your Wio Terminal. 

Once running, the sample will connect to IoT Hub and send telemetry (the values from the IMU sensor) every 2 second. You can use the [Azure IoT Explorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-explorer/releases) to test that data is correctly sent by subscribing to the telemetry feed for your device. Since this sample leverages IoT Plug and Play, Azure IoT Explorer provides you with extra information regarding the data model for your IMU sensor data, e.g the unit of measurement is "g".

Since the IoT Plug and Play model ID used in this sample does not correspond to any official/certified model, you will have to manually instruct Azure IoT Explorer about a local folder where the actual model corresponding to model ID `dtmi:seeed:wioterminal;1` resides. 

You can either manually download [``wioterminal.json``](./wioterminal.json) or clone this repository, and then add the corresponding local folder in the "IoT Plug and Play Settings" of your Azure IoT Explorer. You'll find more information on configuring Azure IoT Explorer [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-pnp/howto-use-iot-explorer#connect-to-your-hub).
